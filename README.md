This is the beginning of my startup application using Git and GitHub
This is the editing of my README.md from github
This is the second change on github
This should create a conflict

Git is a very powerful tool. But I think it requires extra focus on the part of the coder to keep up to date with it or they could be overwhelmed by the amount of options that the tool offers.

# Elevator Pitch
It's time to end the debate once and for all... In Utah, who has the best fried chicken? You've got the classics: KFC, Chick-fil-a, or McDonald's. The alternatives: Sonic, JCW's, Popeye's, or Zaxby's. Or there is the up-and-coming Raising Cane's. If all of the other chicken places had to go, which two would you want to stay? This polling application will allow users to vote on their two favorite restaurants to get fried chicken and allow them to see the votes in real-time. The ability to see the votes in real-time will also allow users new to Utah who have a hankering for fried chicken see the best options available.
